## Description
The motivation of this project is to build a social media API using Mongoose (MongoDB ODM) and Node.js. It defines the data models for the API, such as User and Thoughts, by setting up a MongoDB database and connecting it using Mongoose. It interacts with the data models using Mongoose schemas and also features built-in virtuals and middleware. The routes for the API are set up using Express.js and the application implements CRUD functionality for each model using Mongoose methods. It features server-side validation for incoming data using validator.js. In addition, the application adheres to the Model-View-Controller architecuture.
